Greg Roberts, Development Lead for the BaseSpaces product, "Using BaseSpace, biologists and informaticians can easily and securely analyze, archive and share sequencing data. We were able to leverage RDS for PostgreSQL since first day of launch for our BaseSpace project. We scaled our instances seamlessly as our project grew. Automated backups and automated failovers with Multi-AZ provided us the high availability and protection against data loss that our customers expect."</td>

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database instances can be provisioned with either standard storage or Provisioned IOPS storage. Once provisioned, you can scale from 5GB to 6TB of storage and from 1,000 IOPS to 30,000 IOPS. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL also enables you to scale out beyond the capacity of a single database deployment for read-heavy database workloads.

                  Over the past few years, PostgreSQL has become the preferred open source relational database for many enterprise developers and start-ups, powering leading geospatial and mobile applications. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar PostgreSQL database engine. This means that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS.
